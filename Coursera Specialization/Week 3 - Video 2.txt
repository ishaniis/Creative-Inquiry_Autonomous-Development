Waymo and GM Reports

Waymo Safety Levels - 
Behavioural Levels 
- Handle the Traffic Levels

Functional safety
- Backup & Redundancy

Crash Safety 
as recommended by  NHTSA

Operational safety
- Interfaces are usable and convenient 
- To have passenger have some level control 
as that maintains vehicle safety

Non-Collision Safety

Identify Hazard Scenarios and Potential Migrations

Hazard Assemsment Methods to define safety requirements

- Preliminary Analysis
- Fault Tree
- Design Failure mode and Effect 

Conduct extensive testing
- Simulation testing (10 million miles of testing every day)
- Closed Course Testing

Focus on four most common crashes

Real World Driving Tests
- Start with Smaller fleet, expand steadily

** Waymo dependent on OEM's for their own vehicle

Safety Idealogy for GM 

Addresses all 12 elements of NHTSA Safety Framework 
Iterative Design Model 
- Analyze 
- Build
- Simulate
- Drive

Control Car Production

Comprehensive Risk Management - 
Eliminating risks rather than just avoiding

Safety Processes - 
-- Deductive Analysis
- Fault Tree 
-- Inductive Analysis
- Design & Process FMEA
-- Exploratory Analysis
- HAZOP (Hazard and Operational study)

Safety Thresholds

- Fail Safe's - Redundant Functionality
- SOTIF Evaluation
All critical functionalities is tested in both 
known and unknown environments. 

Types of Testing - 
Performance 
Fault Injection 
Intrusive
Durability
Requirements Validations

Analytical Safety 
Ensuring system works in the theory 
Detailed Analysis applicable to both space-programs and
autonomous vehicles. 

Data Driven Safety 
- Safe only when system has demonstrated that
it work without a fail, reduces accident by 10x

Fault Tree:
- used for preliminary analysis
- top-down approach to analyze
- boolean logic
- decomposition continues until a 

Car Crash 
- Software Failure
- - Bad Code
- - Hacked
- Hardware Failure
- - Manufacturing Defects

Probablisitic Fault Tree Analysis
Use logic gates to construct fault tree

Independent Events
 - OR 
 - AND
When probability is evaluated in leaf nodes
Applied on space-shape and aerospace programs

FAILURE Mode's and effect analysis
- Bottom Up process

A. Failure Mode
B. Effects Analysis

Idea behind FMEA
- to Categorize failure modes by priority
-- Seriousness (S)
-- Frequency (O)
-- Easy to Detect (D)

Quantify all the failure by priority number
RPN = S * O * D

FMEA was developed by Military and defense intially

HAZOP 
- A Qualitative process
- Qualitative brainstorming
- Applied to Complex Processes
- Use 'guide words' to trigger brainstorming approach

Functional Safety Process
(V Level Framework)
Initially we use - HARA (Hazard and Risk Assesment)


SOTIF - 
Failures due to performance limitations and misuse
- Sensor Limitations
- Algorithm Failures
- User Misuse

Designed for Level 0 - 2 Autonomy

SOTIF is an extension of Functional sAfety Process
Behavioural Risk Assessment
It also uses HARA to prevent misuse
HARA - 
Used for unit testing

Driver: 0.000375
Algorithm: 0.00196

Software Failure: 0.04
Extreme Weather Conditions: 0.30
