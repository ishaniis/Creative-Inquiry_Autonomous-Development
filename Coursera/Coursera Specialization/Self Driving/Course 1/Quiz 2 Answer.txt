1.
Proprioceptive Sensors do not interact with the environment, whereas extereoceptive sensors do
Exterioceptive sensors can determine obstacle size
and distance away, whereas proprioceptive sensors cannot

2.
Sensors unaffected by Harsh Sunlight
- Sonar
- Radar


3. 
Synchronization is important to correct sensor fusion

4. 
83.33  (150*2)/3.6

5.
5625

6.
Nightime Image Collection
- Lidar
- Radar

7.
- Localization Map primarily used to estimate vehicle position, 
whereas occupancy grid used to plan collission-free paths

- An occupancy grid uses a dense representation of the 
environment , whereas localization map does not need to be dense


8.
Vehicle State
Planned Paths

9.
Role of the system supervisor
- To ensure that the sensors are working correctly
- To ensure that the maps update at the correct frequencies
