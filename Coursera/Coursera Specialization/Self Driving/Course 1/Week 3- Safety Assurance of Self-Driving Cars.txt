Failure of the Perception Stack

Harm

Risk 
- Probability
- Severity

Hazard - Threat to Safety! 

Hazard Sources
- Mechanical
- Electrical
- Hardware (Computing Hardware)
- Software
- Sensors (Bad or Noisy Sensor Data)
- Behavioural (Incorrect Planning or the design was incorrect)
- Fallback to Driver Fails
- Cyber attack /hacked

NHTSA Safety Recommendations for the Autonomous 
Vehicle Research 
12 Areas
- System Engineering Approach to Safety 
- - Well Planned Software Development Process

12 can be categorized into two major
- Autonomy Design
- Testing and Crash Mitigation

NHTSA recommends - 
- ODD (Operational Design Domain)
- OEDR (Object Event Detection and Response System)
- Fallback
- Traffic Laws are obeyed within the ODD
- Think & protect about cyber malicious agents
- HMI interface - To convey information well within 
the timeline. 

Testing & Crash Mitigation 
- Comprehensive Testing Plan
- - Closed Circuit
- - Simulation
- Crashworthiness
- Post Crash Behaviour
- Data Recording - Black Box Recorder
- Consumer Education and Training - Awareness about the capability and limitations of the deployed autonomous systems
